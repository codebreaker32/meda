"""Figures and animations in the style of the paper (Figs. 4, 7, 8, 9 and 14).

* :mod:`.plots`: training curves (:func:`plot_training_curves`,
  :func:`plot_training_comparison`, :func:`plot_training_panels`), bioassay
  completion probability versus cycles (:func:`plot_completion_cdf`) and
  droplet trajectories on the health map (:func:`plot_routing_path`), plus
  the ``draw_*`` building blocks that draw into an existing axes.
* :mod:`.animation`: GIFs of routing episodes (:func:`record_episode`).

Everything renders through matplotlib's Agg / PDF canvases without pyplot,
so it runs headless.
