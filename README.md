**Reliable droplet routing on MEDA biochips, from deep reinforcement learning to graph neural networks.**

This repository is the base of our B.Tech project (BTP) on **GNN-based droplet
routing for micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) digital microfluidic biochips**.
Its first milestone is a faithful, tested reimplementation of the base paper:

The code uses Python, Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3 and PyTorch. The original
used TF1 and stable-baselines v2.

## The problem in brief

A MEDA biochip moves nanoliter droplets over a grid of thousands of
microelectrodes (MCs) using electrowetting. MCs degrade as they are actuated
(charge trapping), and a degraded MC produces a weaker force, so droplets
moving over it may get stuck. MEDA chips can *sense* each MC's health in real
time. The paper trains a PPO agent with a CNN policy that reads the health
map and steers each droplet around degraded regions. The agent uses an
8-direction action space whose step size adapts to the droplet size.

## What is implemented

| Paper | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Stochastic MEDA model: degradation `D = τ^(n/c)`, `b`-bit health sensing, frontier-based probabilistic moves (Sec. III-A) | `meda_routing.core` |
| Parameterized action space with adaptive step (Sec. III-B, Algorithm 1) | `core/actions.py` |
| Image observation and reward (Sec. III-C/D, Fig. 2) | `envs/` (Gymnasium env `MEDA-Routing-v0`) |
| CNN agent (Table I), PPO, dynamic LR scheduler (Sec. IV-A/B) | `agents/`, `training/` |
| Traditional vs. transfer learning, fault-injection curriculum (Sec. IV-C, Figs. 3, 4, 7, 8) | `training/curriculum.py`, `configs/curricula/` |
| Online adaptation to one aging chip after offline training (Sec. I) | `env.persistent_chip`, `configs/training/online_adaptation_30x30.yaml` |
| Health-agnostic baseline and PRISM-style "formal" optimal strategies (Sec. V-B) | `routers/baseline.py`, `routers/formal.py` |
| COVID-RAT and COVID-PCR bioassays, probability of completion vs. cycles (Fig. 9) | `bioassay/` |
| DRL vs. shortest-path under sensed faults and unsensed defects (Sec. VI, in simulation) | `routers/compare.py` |
| Plots in the style of Figs. 4/7/8, 9 and 14, plus episode GIFs | `viz/` |

The paper leaves many details open, such as the reward coefficients, the
movement model of [18], hazard bounds and PPO settings. These were taken from
the first author's public reference code,
[`melfar87/MEDA`](https://github.com/melfar87/MEDA), and cross-checked against
the saved weights and training logs of the authors' trained model. Every
decision is listed in [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md).

## Validation

The authors published their trained 30×30 agent. Loaded into this
environment (`scripts/evaluate_reference_model.py`), it routes **100% of
300 random jobs successfully in 10.0 cycles** on average, matching its own
training log (99.8–100%, ≈10.5 cycles). This agent never saw our code, so the
simulator reproduces the original dynamics, action semantics and job
distribution. See [docs/RESULTS.md](docs/RESULTS.md) for this check and the
others: reward/distance statistics, health-aware vs. health-agnostic routing,
bioassay timings, and a CPU training run on 16×16 chips. That run learns to
route 96–99% of jobs on healthy chips. It also sets the bar a new agent
should beat on faulty chips: the MDP-optimal formal router.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codebreaker32/meda.git meda-gnn-routing
cd meda-gnn-routing
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"            # installs the `meda` command
pytest                             # run the test suite
```

Requires Python ≥ 3.9. Training the paper-size network is much faster on a
GPU (`ppo.device: auto` picks CUDA when available).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Train the paper's agent H(30, 0%) on healthy 30x30 chips (Table I CNN, PPO, 25 epochs)
meda train --config configs/training/paper_30x30_healthy.yaml
#    ...or a CPU-friendly variant (the reference code's smaller CNN)
meda train --config configs/training/quick_cpu_30x30.yaml

# 2. Training curves (score, success rate, cycles per epoch); they are also
#    redrawn automatically into the run folder after every epoch
meda plot-training runs/paper_30x30_healthy

# 3. Evaluate on 500 random routing jobs, e.g. with 10% injected faults
meda evaluate --model runs/paper_30x30_healthy/seed_0 --set env.fault_fraction=0.1

# 4. DRL vs. shortest-path baseline vs. MDP-optimal "formal" router on identical jobs,
#    with 10% sensed faults and 5% defects the sensors cannot see (Sec. VI)
meda compare --model runs/paper_30x30_healthy/seed_0 --routers drl baseline formal \
    --set env.fault_fraction=0.1 --set env.hidden_defect_fraction=0.05 --jobs 200

# 5. Watch the agent (GIF saved next to the model)
meda render --model runs/paper_30x30_healthy/seed_0 --set env.fault_fraction=0.1
```

`train` and `curriculum` accept any config value as `--set key=value`, for
example `--set schedule.epochs=40`, `--set env.width=60 --set env.height=60`
or `--set ppo.device=cuda`. `evaluate`, `compare` and `render` accept only
`env.*` overrides; their other settings are flags such as `--episodes` or
`--device`. `bioassay` builds its chips from its own flags (`meda bioassay
--help`).

## Running on a GPU

Every command uses the local GPU when there is one: CUDA (the card with the
most free memory), then Apple MPS, then the CPU. `meda devices` shows what is
available. Set `MEDA_DEVICE=cuda:1` (or `cpu`) to choose. Networks are never
forced onto a GPU that is missing; the code falls back to the CPU.

To use the GPU of another machine on your network, for example a lab server
at `192.168.x.x`, prefix the command with `scripts/run_on_gpu_server.sh`:

```bash
# once: ssh-copy-id student@192.168.1.50   (password-less ssh)
GPU_SERVER=student@192.168.1.50 bash scripts/run_on_gpu_server.sh \
    meda train -c configs/training/paper_30x30_healthy.yaml
```

The script copies the code to the server, sets up a virtualenv there on
first use, runs the command on the server's GPU and copies `runs/` back. If
the server cannot be reached or has no GPU, it runs the command locally
instead. `DETACH=1` keeps a long training running on the server after you
disconnect. `... status` shows its progress, and `... fetch` copies the
results back. Settings can be kept in `scripts/gpu_server.env`; see
`scripts/gpu_server.env.example`.

## Where results are saved

Everything a run produces lives in one folder inside this project,
`runs/<name>/seed_<s>/`, whatever directory you start `meda` from:

| file | content |
|---|---|
| `model.zip`, `best_model.zip` | latest model and the model with the best evaluation |
| `checkpoints/epoch_XXX.zip` | full model every `schedule.checkpoint_every` epochs (default 5) and after the last one |
| `progress.csv`, `summary.json`, `config.yaml` | per-epoch metrics, final summary, exact settings |
| `training_curves.png` | score, success rate and cycles, redrawn after every epoch (`runs/<name>/training_curves.png` averages the seeds) |
| `eval/`, `bioassay/`, `episode_seed<k>.gif` | written by `evaluate`, `compare` (CSV + chart), `bioassay` (CSV + CDF plot) and `render` for this model |

Set `MEDA_RUNS_DIR` to keep runs elsewhere. Any `--out` or `-o` you give
explicitly is used as is.

## Reproducing the paper's experiments

| Experiment | Command |
|---|---|
| Fig. 7: healthy chips, sizes 30 … 180 | `meda curriculum -c configs/curricula/traditional_learning.yaml` |
| Fig. 4: random init vs. transfer learning | `meda curriculum -c configs/curricula/transfer_learning.yaml`, then `meda plot-training runs/traditional_learning/s060_f00 runs/transfer_learning/s060_f00 --labels random transfer` |
| Fig. 8: 10% / 20% fault injection (transfer) | stages `s030_f10`, `s030_f20`, `s090_f10`, `s090_f20` of the transfer curriculum |
| Fig. 9: COVID bioassays | `meda train -c configs/training/covid_60x30.yaml`, then `meda bioassay --assay covid-rat --model runs/covid_60x30/seed_0 --trials 1000 --tau-range 0.7 0.7 --c-range 200 200` (and `--assay covid-pcr`). The two range flags reproduce the degradation the authors used for Fig. 9; leave them out for the Sec. V-A ranges. |
| Sec. VI: robustness to degraded electrodes | `meda compare ... --k-max 40` as in the quick start, with `env.fault_fraction` 0 and 0.1 (the prototype runs used a 40-cycle budget per task) |

The paper repeats every training experiment five times. The configs default
to `repeats: 1` to save compute; add `--set repeats=5` for the paper's
protocol, as `scripts/reproduce_paper.sh` does. `meda plot-training
runs/<name>` then draws the mean with a min–max band. Compare success rates
and cycle counts with the paper's figures; the plotted *scores* use a
different scale (see the implementation notes).

## GNN-based routing (the proposed method)

The project's method replaces the paper's CNN encoder with a graph neural
network and keeps everything else fixed: simulator, reward, the 8 actions,
PPO settings and evaluation jobs. The full methodology is in
[docs/GNN_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/GNN_METHODOLOGY.md).

```
 observation (3 x W x H) --> graph: one node per MC --> GCN message passing --> global max --> PPO actor (8 actions)
                             features: health,          (3 layers, d = 64)       pooling       PPO critic V(s)
                             droplet, goal;
                             edges to the 8 neighbours
```

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| Observation → graph (node index `y·W + x`, 8-neighbour edges in both directions, no edge attributes) | `src/meda_routing/representations/graph_builder.py` |
| GCN encoder (plus a direction-aware ablation) as a PPO feature extractor, `agent.extractor: gnn` | `src/meda_routing/agents/gnn.py` |
| Readouts: global max pooling (default), mean, sum, role-aware | `src/meda_routing/agents/graph_readout.py` |
| Configs identical to the CNN baseline except the encoder | `configs/training/gnn_maxpool_30x30.yaml`, `gnn_maxpool_16x16.yaml` |
| CNN vs. GNN on the same held-out jobs → `results/tables`, `results/logs`, `results/figures` | `meda compare-methods`, `src/meda_routing/experiments/method_comparison.py` |

```bash
meda validate-graph -c configs/training/gnn_maxpool_30x30.yaml     # graph checks
meda train -c configs/training/gnn_maxpool_30x30.yaml --set repeats=5
meda compare-methods --method CNN-PPO runs/paper_30x30_healthy \
                     --method GNN-maxpool-PPO runs/gnn_maxpool_30x30
bash scripts/run_gnn_experiment.sh          # all of the above; SIZE=16 SEEDS=1 for a CPU-sized run
```

GCN with max pooling has a known limitation: it cannot tell a job from its
mirror image. The methodology document (section 14) explains why and names
the two ablations prepared for it. To plug in other architectures, see
[docs/EXTENDING.md](docs/EXTENDING.md).
